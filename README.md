Example_CameraProjectorCalibration
==================================

- pre-processing of acquired images with color based segmentation (this data should be in the pattern calibration file)
- color picker 
- 3d representation of camera/projector configuration in a separate viewport (with axis and mouse controlled rotation to check some things, like camera orientation, etc)
- openCV 2.4 would avoid slowing down image acquisition when the board is not on the image. 


- DEMOS:
 - use the modified rectangle finder (with tracking) to do AR.
